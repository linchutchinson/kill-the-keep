# Kill the Keep

A clone of Slay the Spire built in Rust with Macroquad and Legion ECS.

## Known Issues

* Temporary Cards (Such as those created by Anger) are not removed at the end of combat. This could be solved by placing a temporary tag on them and removing temp cards at the end of combat.

* Upgrading cards is not implemented. As such, Armaments is withheld from the card pool.
